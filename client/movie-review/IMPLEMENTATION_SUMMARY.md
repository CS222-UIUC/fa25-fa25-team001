# Gaming Platform Connections - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a system that allows users to **link** their gaming platform accounts (Steam, Nintendo, Xbox, PlayStation) to access their playtime data.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Authentication Note**: Users sign in with email/password only. Platform accounts are linked solely for data access (playtime tracking), not for authentication.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema ‚úÖ
- Added `PlatformConnection` model to Prisma schema
- Stores platform type, user ID, OAuth tokens, and cached game data
- Relationships with User model
- Database schema updated and migrations applied

### 2. Server Actions ‚úÖ
Created `src/actions/platform.ts` with:
- `getUserPlatformConnections()` - Fetch all connections for a user
- `connectPlatform()` - Connect a new platform account
- `disconnectPlatform()` - Remove a platform connection
- `updatePlatformData()` - Update cached game data

### 3. API Routes ‚úÖ

#### Steam Integration (Fully Implemented)
- `POST /api/platforms/steam/connect` - Connect Steam account by Steam ID
- `GET /api/platforms/steam/games` - Fetch games with playtime data from Steam API

#### General Platform Routes
- `DELETE /api/platforms/disconnect` - Disconnect any platform

### 4. UI Components ‚úÖ

#### PlatformConnections Component
Created `src/components/PlatformConnections.tsx` with:
- Steam connection interface (fully functional)
- Input field for Steam ID with helpful link to steamid.io
- Connect/Disconnect buttons
- Sync Games button to fetch latest data
- Display of cached game data including:
  - Game titles
  - Total playtime in hours
  - Last played dates
- Placeholder sections for Nintendo, Xbox, and PlayStation (marking them as "Coming Soon")

### 5. Profile Page Integration ‚úÖ
Updated `src/app/user/profile/page.tsx` to:
- Import and display PlatformConnections component
- Show platform connections in a dedicated section below profile info

## How to Use

### For Users:
1. **Sign in** with your email/password (normal login)
2. Navigate to `/user/profile` page
3. Scroll to "Link Gaming Platforms" section
4. For Steam:
   - Find your Steam ID at [steamid.io](https://steamid.io/)
   - Enter it in the input field
   - Click "Connect Steam" to link your account
   - Click "Sync Games" to fetch your library
5. View your games with playtime data

**Remember**: You still sign in with email/password - platforms are just linked for data.

### For Developers:

#### Setup Steam API Key:
1. Get API key from https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey
2. Add to `.env`:
   ```
   STEAM_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

#### Database Setup:
```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Push schema changes (already done)
npx prisma db push
```

#### Running the App:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ Steam
- Manual Steam ID connection (no OAuth required for basic usage)
- Fetches owned games from Steam Web API
- Displays playtime in hours
- Shows last played dates
- Caches data in database
- Sync button to refresh data

### üöß Other Platforms (Structure Ready)
- Database schema supports all platforms
- UI placeholders created
- Ready for OAuth integration

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- `src/actions/platform.ts` - Server actions for platform management
- `src/app/api/platforms/steam/connect/route.ts` - Steam connection endpoint
- `src/app/api/platforms/steam/games/route.ts` - Steam games data endpoint
- `src/app/api/platforms/disconnect/route.ts` - Platform disconnection endpoint
- `src/components/PlatformConnections.tsx` - UI component
- `PLATFORM_CONNECTIONS.md` - Feature documentation
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Modified:
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added PlatformConnection model and User relationship
- `src/app/user/profile/page.tsx` - Added PlatformConnections component

## Data Flow

1. User enters Steam ID in UI
2. `PlatformConnections` component calls `/api/platforms/steam/connect`
3. API creates `PlatformConnection` record in database
4. User clicks "Sync Games"
5. API fetches games from Steam Web API
6. Games data is stored in `gamesData` JSON field
7. UI displays games with playtime information

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Current State:**
- OAuth tokens are stored but not encrypted (fine for development)
- Steam connection uses API key (safe, no user credentials)

üö® **Production Requirements:**
- Encrypt `accessToken` and `refreshToken` fields
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement rate limiting on API calls
- Add request validation

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term:
- [ ] Encrypt OAuth tokens in database
- [ ] Add loading states and better error handling
- [ ] Implement data refresh scheduling

### OAuth Integrations:
- [ ] Nintendo Account OAuth
- [ ] Microsoft/Xbox OAuth
- [ ] PlayStation OAuth

### Advanced Features:
- [ ] Auto-sync on login
- [ ] Playtime analytics and charts
- [ ] Trophy/achievement tracking
- [ ] Game recommendations based on play history
- [ ] Friends' gaming activity feed

## Technical Notes

### Steam API:
- Uses Steam Web API (GetOwnedGames endpoint)
- Requires STEAM_API_KEY environment variable
- Returns games with playtime in minutes
- Last played as Unix timestamp

### Data Structure:
```typescript
gamesData: [
  {
    id: 12345,
    name: "Game Title",
    playtimeHours: "10.5",
    playtimeMinutes: 630,
    lastPlayed: "2024-01-15T00:00:00.000Z",
    platform: "steam"
  }
]
```

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Log in to the app
3. Go to `/user/profile`
4. Connect a Steam account with a valid Steam ID
5. Click "Sync Games"
6. Verify games appear with playtime data

## Success Criteria Met ‚úÖ

- [x] Users can connect Steam account
- [x] Access playtime data
- [x] View last played dates
- [x] Database schema supports all platforms
- [x] UI is intuitive and functional
- [x] Code is well-documented
- [x] No linting errors

## Notes

- Nintendo, Xbox, and PlayStation currently show as "Coming Soon" - the infrastructure is in place but OAuth integration requires platform-specific setup
- Steam implementation uses a manual Steam ID approach (simpler than OAuth for this use case)
- The system is designed to be easily extended for other platforms
